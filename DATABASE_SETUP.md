# Database Migration Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Your ReconPro application has been successfully migrated from localStorage to a proper database using Supabase. This guide will help you complete the setup.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

1. **Supabase Account**: Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Environment Variables**: You'll need to set up environment variables

## ðŸš€ Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
# Get these values from your Supabase project dashboard
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Step 2: Get Supabase Credentials

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings > API
3. Copy the "Project URL" and "anon public" key
4. Paste them in your `.env` file

### Step 3: Run the Database Schema

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the database schema (you should have this from earlier)
4. Run the demo data inserts (you should have this from earlier)

### Step 4: Test the Application

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Try registering a new dealership
3. Test adding vehicles and other features

## âœ… What's Been Migrated

### âœ… **Completed Migrations:**
- **Authentication**: Now uses Supabase Auth
- **User Management**: Profiles stored in database
- **Dealership Management**: Full dealership data in database
- **Vehicle Management**: All vehicle operations use database
- **Dashboard**: Updated to use database service

### ðŸ”„ **Still Using localStorage (for now):**
- Location Management
- Contact Management
- Todo Management
- Settings Management
- Analytics

## ðŸŽ‰ Benefits of the Migration

1. **Real-time Data**: Changes sync across all users
2. **Data Persistence**: No more lost data on browser clear
3. **Scalability**: Can handle multiple users and dealerships
4. **Security**: Proper authentication and authorization
5. **Backup**: Automatic database backups
6. **Analytics**: Better data analysis capabilities

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Missing Supabase environment variables"**
   - Make sure your `.env` file exists and has the correct values
   - Restart your development server after adding environment variables

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check that your Supabase project is active
   - Verify your API keys are correct

3. **"Database connection error"**
   - Ensure your database schema has been created
   - Check that RLS policies are properly configured

## ðŸ“ž Support

If you encounter any issues during setup, check:
1. Supabase documentation
2. Your browser's developer console for errors
3. The application logs for detailed error messages

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

Once this basic setup is working, you can:
1. Migrate the remaining localStorage features (locations, contacts, todos, etc.)
2. Add more advanced features like real-time updates
3. Implement user roles and permissions
4. Add analytics and reporting features
